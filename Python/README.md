# Python Proficiencies

The purpose of this repository is demonstrate my capabilities in programming languages
through tinkering projects & coding challenges.
The concept behind each project should be as simple as viewing something neat,
while simultaneously making it easy to figure out how the project was made.

## Getting Started
* 1: Download & install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* 2: Pick the project you're curious about.
* 3: Open that project in IDLE (This was installed with Python).
* 4: Look at your top menu, click "Run", then click "Run Module".
* 3: If you find any problems, [reach out to me here](mailto:markpuchalaii@gmail.com)
