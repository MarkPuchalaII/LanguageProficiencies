# Java Proficiencies

Here you can find projects I've worked on in Java.
I've not found much reason to use it, anymore.
So there isn't much here.

## Getting Started

* Step 1 with Java is to make sure you've installed the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

* 1: Make sure a path to Java is setup in your environment variables.
  If you can't type `javac -version` in your terminal, you'll have to set it up yourself.

* 2: After that, just find the FILENAME of whichever file you downloaded (such as the FILENAME "helloWorld" in helloWorld.java), and type as follows:
`javac FILENAME.java`
`java FILENAME`

* 3: If you find any problems, [reach out to me here](mailto:markpuchalaii@gmail.com)
