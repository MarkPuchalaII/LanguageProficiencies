# Language Proficiencies

The purpose of this repository is demonstrate my capabilities in programming languages
through tinkering projects & coding challenges.
The concept behind each project should be as simple as viewing something neat,
while simultaneously making it easy to figure out how the project was made.

More information will be coming soon.
