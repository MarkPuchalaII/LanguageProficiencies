# Javascript Proficiencies

The purpose of this repository is demonstrate my capabilities in programming languages
through tinkering projects & coding challenges.
The concept behind each project should be as simple as viewing something neat,
while simultaneously making it easy to figure out how the project was made.

## Getting Started
* This one's real simple:
* 1: Pick a project you're curious about.
* 2: Open that project's "index.html" file in your favorite web browser.
* 3: If you find any problems, [reach out to me here](mailto:markpuchalaii@gmail.com)

## Acknowledgments

* [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) for helping javascript even more approachable than normal.
