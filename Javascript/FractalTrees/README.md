# Fractal Trees - A Recursive Solution

This is a recursive solution to creating a Fractal Tree, using P5.js
It has a slider to adjust the angle at which its branches grow.
I made this following along with **Daniel Shiffman's** own coding challenge over the same thing.

## Getting Started

* Download the FractalTrees folder
* Open index.html
* Enjoy your fractal tree, complete with a slider!

## Built With

* [P5.js](https://p5js.org) - The Javascript library used to create this Fractal Tree

## Acknowledgments

* **Daniel Shiffman** for demonstrating this in a coding challenge
